## Behind the scenes

This directory contains our progress on making the final obfuscated code, starting with a Python reference implementation, a C reference implementation, and several intermediate stages of obfuscation. `sandbox.c` contains some ideas and testing for obfuscation techniques.

To compile, run `make docs/sandbox` in the *parent directory*.
