## Requirements 
You need C89 and make to run our code. 

## How to Run 
1. Choose whether to encode/decode 
To decode: do nothing 
To Encode: remove the 3 lines that say `DELETE ME` to make the padlock appear locked 
2. Make the executable: `make` 
3. Execute: `./gridlock key text` where `key` is the key you want to use for the cipher and `text` is the text to be encoded/decoded

## Output 
- If the output is a string of characters like `ogpyk` that is your encrypted/decrypted result! 
- If the output is `Usage: ./gridlock key text` then you did not enter the correct number of arguments 
- If the program quits unexpectedly, then your input was not valid. Only alphabetic characters are accepted for the key and text
